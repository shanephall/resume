# Hello!

I'm Shane Hall, a product and technology leader with a passion for building impactful products and high-performing teams.

## To make a long story short...

I studied physics at Cal Poly Pomona and was fortunate to start my career at Userplane, a startup where I cut my teeth helping customers integrate chat apps. Naturally, I began bringing ideas for new features to the engineering team, which led to a full transition into product management. I helped scale the business, working closely with customers and engineering peers to deliver value, ultimately leading to the companyâ€™s acquisition by AOL.

After a brief stint at AOL, I was recruited to MySpace by my former Userplane boss to lead product and design for their core offering. From there, I joined Zynga, where I led the relaunch of Zynga.com, scaling it to over 1M daily active users. Next, I joined The Hunt as its first product manager, building out the product and design teams, transitioning the platform to mobile, and launching apps for iOS and Androidâ€”all culminating in the companyâ€™s acquisition by Pinterest.

Most recently, I joined former Zynga colleagues at Change.org, where I joined as head of mobile and ultimately promoted to product leadership over growth and AI/ML. Along the way, Iâ€™ve stayed driven by my innate curiosity, a passion for building products that make a difference, and working closely with talented folks to solve big problems.
